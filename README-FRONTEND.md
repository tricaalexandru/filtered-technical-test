# Frontend Challenge (2-3hrs)

Please read this whole document before starting the challenge.

Users should be able to select assets from the left-hand sidebar, and have them appear in the Menu preview.

For this challenge, we would like you to:

- Populate assets in the left-hand sidebar with data from `assets.js`.
- Allow users to select assets in the left-hand sidebar, and have them appear in the Learning Assets Preview on the right hand side.
- Be able to remove assets from the menu by clicking the (x)
- Show the total number of selected assets in the header
- Show the total number of each asset type selected in the header
- Add tests for both React and Redux, what you feel should be tested

If you feel comfortable, try allowing the user to drag and drop assets (instead of select) from the sidebar into Menu
Preview. (react-dnd is really useful, but sensible alternatives are fine).

Please complete `FRONTEND-NOTES.md` with your details and any additional notes outlining your thought process.
Enter as many notes as you like (or none at all!). These will be used to create talking points during your interview.

We do not want you to:

- Overstyle the application. Feel free to add niceties if you'd like, but please don't spend too much time on this.
- Change the build configuration of the project
- Worry too much about browser compatibility or responsiveness (it will be tested in Chrome on a Mac).

We would like you to use REDUX for the state management, as this is what we use on our application.
We are looking for clean code, with sensible component structure and data propagation.

If you have any issues please email at@filtered.com.

Good luck!
